# HuSecurity's Webapp

This is the WebApp built using React and Nexo. Ideally this will be easily translatable between Laptop, Android, IOS.

## What is It?

HuSecurity is a school scholarship project that connects to a external motion tracking camera. Ideally if the user wants to use their own camera I can put 
the code ontop of their camera feed and the AI will still be able to detect humans. My external motion tracking camera is going to be made on a Raspberry Pi 4
that will display the live feed to a undisclosed link which will then also be displayed on the app. This will also have a playback feature. 

## Planned Features

- Login including Google/Other Sign Up option
- Dedictated page for viewing camera connected to a live feed.
- Playback Features
- Multiple Cameras
- Device Manager page for camera's
- Ability for user to add own camera
- User Control the motion tracked camera (Very Skeptical Additon)
